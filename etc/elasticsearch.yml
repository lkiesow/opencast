## Elasticsearch Configuration

# Cluster name identifies your cluster for auto-discovery. If you're running
# multiple clusters on the same network, make sure you're using unique names.
cluster.name: opencast

#################################### Paths ####################################

path.home: ${karaf.home}/

# Path to directory where to store index data allocated for this node.
#
#path.data: /path/to/data
#
# Can optionally include more than one location, causing data to be striped across
# the locations (a la RAID 0) on a file level, favouring locations with most free
# space on creation. For example:
#
path.data: ${karaf.data}/index/data

# Path to log files:
#
path.logs: ${karaf.data}/log/


############################## Network And HTTP ###############################

# Elasticsearch, by default, binds itself to the 0.0.0.0 address, and listens
# on port [9200-9300] for HTTP traffic and on port [9300-9400] for node-to-node
# communication. (the range means that if the port is busy, it will automatically
# try the next port).

# Set the bind address specifically (IPv4 or IPv6):
#network.bind_host: 192.168.0.1

# Set the address other nodes will use to communicate with this node. If not
# set, it is automatically derived. It must point to an actual IP address.
#network.publish_host: 192.168.0.1

# Set both 'bind_host' and 'publish_host':
network.host: 127.0.0.1

# Set a custom port for the node to node communication (9300 by default):
#transport.tcp.port: 9300

# Set a custom port to listen for HTTP traffic:
#http.port: 9200

# Set a custom allowed content length:
#http.max_content_length: 100mb

# Disable HTTP completely:
#http.enabled: false


################################## Shutdown ###################################

# Disable the Elasticsearch Shutdown API (recomended).
action.disable_shutdown: true
