Exsample diff for the `oc_search` table

The main differences we see and need to overcome are:

1. The ordering is different
2. Indexes are missing in the generated version
3. Constraints are missing in the generated version
4. Field types and sizes are different


Ordering
--------

Unfortunately, it seems like [hibernate always sorts columns alphabetically](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1298327) and
there is no way to change that. Thus, the only option would be to re-order the database tables previously generated by
Opencast's DDL script. That leads to a long database migrationl.

In theory, the ordering does not matter to Opencast. But you never know for which tool it later does.
