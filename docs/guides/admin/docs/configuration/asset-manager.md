Asset Manager Configuration
===========================

Config Options
--------------

### File System Based Asset Store

Configure the file system based asset store in custom.properties.

- `org.opencastproject.episode.rootdir`
   The path where the file system based asset store of the default implementation stores the assets. This key is optional.
- `org.opencastproject.storage.dir`
  This is Opencastâ€™s general config key to configure the base path of everything storage related.
  If no storage directory is configured explicitely, the file system based asset store will use
  `${org.opencastproject.storage.dir}/archive` as its base path.

Deployment
----------

The following bundles have to be added to the `system.properties`

- asset-manager-api
- asset-manager-impl
- asset-manager-storage-fs
- asset-manager-util
- asset-manager-workflowoperation

### How can I use a different storage backend?

Replace the `asset-manager-storage-fs` bundle with another bundle that exports an implementation of the `AssetStore` interface.

### How can I use a totally different AssetManager implementation?

Replace both `asset-manager-impl` and `asset-manager-storage-fs` bundles
with a bundle that exports an implementation of the `asset-manager-api`.
