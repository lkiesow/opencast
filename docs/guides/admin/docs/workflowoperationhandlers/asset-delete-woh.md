Asset Manager Delete Workflow Operation
=======================================

ID: `asset-delete`

Description
-----------

The delete handler is responsible for deleting an episode, identified by the workflowâ€™s current media package, from the
asset manager.

If no parameter is given, the whole episode and all of its snapshots are deleted.
If the keep-last-snapshot parameter is used, it is advised to use the *ingest-download* workflow before *asset-delete*.
Otherwise there will be logged a lot of errors for unreferenced snapshots and ACLs may vanish.
